# Plot Fast

Sketch a simple chart (like in MS Paint) on the canvas. Plot Fast uses Google's Gemini vision model (API key required) to interpret your drawing and attempts to render it as an XKCD-style chart using the `chart.xkcd` library. Just draw your axes, labels (optional), and data, then hit convert!
